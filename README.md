Data Set Description

The heating load (HL) and the cooling load (CL) is required for speciation of the cooling and
heating equipment when it comes to design efficient building, to maintain comfortable indoor air
conditions based on user requirements. To evaluate the required heating and cooling capacities in
the building, engineers and building designers need information about the characteristics of the
buildings and of the inured space (for instance orientation, occupancies and dimensions). For this
reason, the dataset consists of 8 input variables namely surface area, relative compactness, glazing
area distribution, overall height, orientation, wall area, glazing area and, roof area to determine the
output variables Heating Load and Cooling Load of residential buildings.

The dataset consists of 768 data points and 8 input features, aiming to classify two real valued
responses [1]. The labels are transformed into classes by approximating each class based on range
of data defined. The project looked into evaluating the cooling load and heating load requirements
of building as a function of building parameters to improve the efficiency of the building and
Energy analyzes using 12 different building shapes simulated in software Ecotect. The buildings
differ with respect to the orientation, the glazing area distribution, and glazing area, amongst other
parameters. The project converts to multi-class classification problem as it converts the responses
to rounded to the nearest integer and defining classes based on the range defined.

The dataset contains eight input features and two labels. The aim is to use the eight features to
predict each of the one response (Heating Load), Cooling Load is not considered as label in this
project.

Specifically:
• Relative Compactness
• Roof Area
• Surface Area
• Wall Area
• Glazing Area Distribution
• Orientation
• Glazing Area
• Overall Height
• Cooling Load
• Heating Load

In this project the aim is for classification, hence heating load is only considered for classification
by defining each class.
